This app is for musicians that want something to keep track of the Tempo.    It uses BPM (60,000 ms (1 minute) / Tempo (BPM) = Delay Time in ms) as the
point of reference for speed.

  ## HowTo:  
The App consists of two Fragments. One is the Mainscreen where you can 
choose the amount of BPM the Tracker should tick with. Either by pressing    the TextView directly and use the keyboard, or by using one of the four      buttons (+1,+5,-1,-5) which increments or decrements the value. When you set the BPM you can hit the Play Button for the App to start the Clock.
The Profile Button can be used to choose a specific BPM Profile. In a later version, this can be edited by the user.
